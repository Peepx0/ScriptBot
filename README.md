# ScriptBot
This is a bot coded in JavaScript for creating &amp; searching scripts. This is meant for the game ROBLOX but it doesn't have to be used for that.

## How to use this
Make sure you have a bot application ready on discord, then open "ScriptBot.js" in an editor and go to the very bottom and change "Your bot token goes here" to the bot applications token, then just run the bot by doing "node ScriptBot.js".

## Requirements
To use this you must have Discord.js installed.
